# The EdGENI Project

## Introduction

*EdGENI* is an educational experiment solution built on top of *GENI (Global Environment for Network Innovations)*. It includes the following features:

* It is a solution that introduces a desktop environment to the GENI VM and allows users to save, duplicate, and share VM environments with other users. 
* It introduces a client application, *PuTTY Connect*, to simplify making VM connections. Putty Connect improve the user experience and extend the user base of GENI, thus delivering a generalized experiment platform for computer education. 
* It also includes a series of experiments, covering topics of cybersecurity and blockchain. These labs are suitable for a wide range of students, from entry-level students who are unfamiliar with command-line interface to advanced students who are interested in sophisticated network attacks and preventions. 

## Getting Started with Labs
* To get started with the labs, you will need to register a GENI user account, generate your SSH keys, and Join the GENI Project. You can find the instructions to perform those tasks within [Setup User](Environment%20Setup/1-Setup-User.docx).
* Furthuremore, you will also need to create a lab environment on GENI. You can find the instructions within [Setup Lab](Environment%20Setup/2-Setup-Lab.docx).
* In order to perform labs on the virtual machines, you will first need to connect to VMs using instructions within [Connect To VM](Environment%20Setup/3-Connect-VM.docx).
* If you feel it will be easier to go through tutorial videos rather than going through the instructions, feel free to go through the following videos in the top to bottom order:

* Once you are connected to VMs, feel free to try our [Labs](Labs/) which contains experiments, covering topics of cybersecurity such as ARP Poisoning, Privilege Escalation, Denial of Service, Nmap Enumeration, Password CTF and blockchain such as Smart Contract.
