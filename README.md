# The EdGENI Project

## Introduction

*EdGENI* is an educational experiment solution built on top of *GENI (Global Environment for Network Innovations)*. It includes the following features:

* It is a solution that introduces a desktop environment to the GENI VM and allows users to save, duplicate, and share VM environments with other users. 
* It introduces a client application, *PuTTY Connect*, to simplify making VM connections. Putty Connect improve the user experience and extend the user base of GENI, thus delivering a generalized experiment platform for computer education. 
* It also includes a series of experiments, covering topics of cybersecurity and blockchain. These labs are suitable for a wide range of students, from entry-level students who are unfamiliar with command-line interface to advanced students who are interested in sophisticated network attacks and preventions.
